## Wine Classification using K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

This Jupyter Notebook demonstrates a basic classification task using the K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm from the `scikit-learn` library. The notebook utilizes the popular **UCI Wine dataset** to classify wine into three distinct classes based on various chemical properties.

### Contents:
- **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: The notebook begins by loading the wine dataset, preparing it for the model by splitting it into training and test sets.
  
- **Model Training**: A KNN model with 7 neighbors (`n_neighbors=7`) is trained on the dataset to classify the wines into one of the three classes.
  
- **Prediction and Evaluation**: The notebook includes code for predicting the test set values and calculating the accuracy of the model.

- **Visualization**: It generates a line plot that compares the actual target values from the test set against the predicted values from the model, highlighting the model's performance visually. The graph shows minimal deviation between actual and predicted values, indicating high accuracy.

### Key Features:
- **Model**: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) with `n_neighbors=7`.
- **Accuracy**: The accuracy of the model is calculated using `scikit-learn`'s `metrics` module.
- **Visualization**: A line plot and scatter plot to visually assess how well the model's predictions match the actual values.

This notebook is an excellent starting point for understanding how KNN works for classification tasks and how to evaluate and visualize model performance.

The graph you provided shows both the actual and predicted values from your model. Here's a detailed explanation of what the graph is telling:

### Key Points from the Graph:
1. **X-Axis (Data Points)**: The horizontal axis represents the individual data points from the test set. Each point corresponds to a specific observation or sample.
   
2. **Y-Axis (Target Values)**: The vertical axis represents the target class labels (in this case, wine classes) ranging from 0 to 2.

3. **Blue Line (Actual Values)**: This line shows the actual target labels from the test set. Each point in the line represents the true label for the corresponding data point.

4. **Red Dashed Line (Predicted Values)**: The red dashed line represents the predictions made by your KNeighborsClassifier model. Each point shows what the model predicted for the corresponding data point.

### Interpretation:
- **Overlap of Lines**: You can see that for many data points, the red and blue lines overlap, indicating that the predicted values match the actual values. This shows that the model predicted correctly in these cases.
  
- **Mismatches**: If there were any significant gaps or differences between the blue and red lines, they would indicate where the model's prediction was incorrect. In this graph, however, the lines appear to overlap almost entirely, suggesting that the model performed quite well.

### Conclusion:
- The graph suggests that your model's predictions are highly accurate, with minimal differences between actual and predicted values. Based on the visual inspection, the KNeighborsClassifier is likely classifying the wine types with high accuracy.

You could further quantify the accuracy by looking at the accuracy score you've printed in the earlier steps to confirm this visual observation.
Here's an interactive guide to install and run the KNN_BASIC repository on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Git Bash).
2. Run the following command to clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sounakss7/KNN_BASIC.git

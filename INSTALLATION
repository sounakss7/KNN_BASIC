Here's an interactive guide to install and run the KNN_BASIC repository on your local machine:

### Step 1: Clone the Repository
1. Open a terminal (Command Prompt or Git Bash).
2. Run the following command to clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/sounakss7/KNN_BASIC.git
   ```
   
### Step 2: Navigate to the Directory
Change into the project folder:
   ```bash
   cd KNN_BASIC
   ```

### Step 3: Create a Virtual Environment (optional but recommended)
Set up a Python virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

### Step 4: Install Dependencies
Install the required packages:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Step 5: Run the Jupyter Notebook
Start Jupyter to run the KNN analysis:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook KNN_BASIC.ipynb
   ```

Once launched, follow along with the steps in the notebook to execute the K-Nearest Neighbors algorithm using the provided Wine dataset.
